## Installation
This code requires [Node to be installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your machine to run.  You also need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

First, `cd` into the `backend` directory and install the backend packages:

```
npm i
```

Next, `cd` into the frontend directory and install the frontend packages:

```
npm i
```

## Usage

In the `backend` directory, start the backend server:

```
npm run start
```

You should see a message like `Express server is running on localhost:3001`.

Next, in a new terminal window, `cd` into the frontend directory and start the frontend server:

```
npm run start
```

You should see a message like `You can now view science37-frontend in the browser.`

Open http://localhost:3000/ to view the app.

## Test Cases

You can run test cases from the `frontend` directory with `npm run test`.
